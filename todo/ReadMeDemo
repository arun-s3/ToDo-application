Absolutely — here’s a comprehensive, detailed feature breakdown of ZenTask that you can use for documentation, landing pages, pitch decks, README, or interview answers. I’ll include core features, edge-case behaviors, loader design, UX decisions, and motivations behind each part.

⭐️ ZenTask — Full Feature Overview

ZenTask is a modern, intuitive task management application designed to help users organize work, track progress, and stay productive. It supports both authenticated users and guest users, giving a smooth experience even before signing in.

🧠 1. Authentication & Identity
✅ Guest Mode

Before a user signs in, ZenTask automatically:

Creates a guestId using crypto.randomUUID()

Stores it in localStorage (guestId)

Assigns temporary demo tasks

Persists guest tasks via the API with the x-guest-id header

Benefits:

Zero friction first experience

Users can immediately interact and test

Tasks are preserved until migration

✅ Sign In / Sign Up

ZenTask supports:

Credential submission via secure API

Automatic migration of guest tasks upon sign-in

Removal of guestId on migration

Persistent user data

Auth State Flags:

authLoading — UI loader for network activity

authReady — user identity has been determined

isAppHydrating / isAuthStabilizing — transition loader while UI catches up

This prevents:

Flash of incorrect UI (hero / task list)

Mid-UX flickers during auth transitions

📍 2. Initial UI States & Loader Design
🌀 Auth Stabilizing Loader

Used during:

App startup (initial auth check)

Sign-in / Sign-out

Fetch transitions

Visual Design:

Soft pulsing ZenTask logo

Faint “Preparing your workspace…” text

Works in both light/dark mode

Intentional animation pacing (1.8s cycle)

Purpose:

Avoids abrupt content changes

Eliminates flash of hero or stale tasks

Communicates backend latency gracefully

🏠 3. Home & Hero Experience
📌 Hero Section (Empty State)

Shown when:

No tasks exist (new user/guest)

Only demo tasks exist and not yet seen

Key UX Elements:

Title: “Your Productivity Starts Here”

Quick Tips (Star, Set Priorities, Add Deadlines, Use Tags)

Feature Highlights (Dashboard, Smart Organization, Real-Time)

Step-by-Step Instructions

Notices for Guest Mode & Migration

CTA to create the first task

Loaded With:

Animations (card fade-ins)

Visual icons (Lucide icons)

Light/Dark theming

🗂 4. Task Management Core
📄 Task List

Paginated (default limit 5)

Filterable & sortable

Searchable

Demo filtering logic (show only one demo if not seen)

Maintains stable UI during server fetches

📊 Sorting Options

Users can reorder tasks by:

date-desc (newest first)

date-asc (oldest first)

priority-high

priority-low

starred

deadline earliest

deadline-latest

Sorting is implemented:

On backend for fetch

Locally via sortTasksLocally for quick UI transitions

Priority uses a priorityRank (1–3) system for consistency.

🧰 5. Task CRUD & Optimistic UI
⬆️ Create

Optimistic insertion with temporary ID

UI update immediately

Reconciliation with backend response

✏️ Edit

Inline editable fields (title/desc)

Submit updates via API

Rollback on failure

🗑 Delete

Interactive modal confirmation

Demo task special handling:

If deleted, mark hasSeenDemoTask = true

Prevent re-injection

☑️ Toggle Done

Instant local UI update

Patch to backend

Removes from list if filtered by done state

⭐️ Toggle Star

Local optimistic UI change

API patch

Synchronization state (starSyncing)

🎯 6. Smart Filters & Local Enhancements
📍 Filter Logic

getFilteredTasks() delivers:

All non-demo tasks

Demo task shown once if not seen

Supports search + tag rules

Demo Logic:
Handled via localStorage hasSeenDemoTask or user flag
Ensures users don’t repeatedly see demo content.

⚡ Local Sorting

sortTasksLocally() handles reordering without re-fetching:

Uses priorityRank, not string compare

Intuitive deadline sorting

Starred tasks first

🚦 7. Progress & Checklist UI
📊 Checklist Support

Partial progress bars

Completion ratio

Expand/collapse behavior

Toggle individual checklist items

📈 Progress Section

Shows:

% completed

Animated progress fill

Real-time UI response

🏷 8. Metadata & Badges

Tasks display:

Deadline (formatted nicely)

Priority badge (color coded)

Tag count

Tag chips

Status icons

Badges are:

Readable

Consistent UI

Semantic for accessibility

🎨 9. Theming & Dark Mode
⚙️ Fully supported

Components adapt to isDarkMode

CSS overrides ensure contrast and visual comfort

Logo loader, hero, skeletons, badges adjust colors

Priority & tag colors alter subtly in dark mode

Dark Mode Enhancements:

Softer shadows

Muted backgrounds

Shimmer effects slightly darker

Skeleton gradients tailored

🪩 10. Loading Indicators All Around

ZenTask uses tiered loaders for clarity:

🔹 AuthStabilizingLoader

Global skeleton / fade-in logo
Used during auth transitions

🔹 Skeleton TaskCardLoader

List placeholders where tasks appear
Mimics full task card structure

🔹 Spinner Loader

Small loader during backend re-fetch
Shows above task list

🔹 Local UI Shimmers

Used inside task card placeholders
Indicates ongoing state (e.g., starSyncing)

📡 11. Resilience & Error Handling
✅ Axios Safe Catch

Robust error parsing:

error?.response?.data?.message || error?.message


Avoids:

Crash on undefined

Unhandled promise rejections

📌 Toast Notifications

Used consistently for user feedback:

Success messages (e.g., registration)

Failure alerts

🛡 12. Backend Design Constraints
🧱 Schema Design

isGuest vs userId

isDemo flags

Unique partial filter indexes

priorityRank synchronized on save

This ensures:

One demo per user/guest

Stable sorting

Efficient queries

🧩 13. Performance & UX Decisions
⏱ Smooth Transitions

Minimum loader time to prevent flicker

Delay logic avoids UI jumps

Deferred pagination updates

📦 General UX Approach

No layout jumps
No intermediate wrong content
Instant yet accurate updates
